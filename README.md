# CarlaMCP - Carla Model Context Protocol Integration

##### Call for Proposals for Fetures üö®‚ùóÔ∏è: Kindly create an issue with your proposal to have discussion/implementation.

## Overview
CarlaMCP is a Python package that provides an interface for integrating Carla with the Model Context Protocol (MCP). It allows users to interact with Carla's simulation environment and manage model contexts using MCP. The package is designed to facilitate the development of autonomous driving applications by providing a seamless connection between Carla and MCP.

## Features
- [x] Integration with Carla simulation environment
- [x] Support for Model Context Protocol (MCP)
- [x] Easy-to-use API for managing model contexts
- [ ] Support for various Carla sensors and actors
- [ ] Ability to run simulations and collect data

## Installation
To install CarlaMCP, you can use uv. Make sure you have Python 3.10 or higher installed.

```bash
uv run main.py
```

#### Alert ‚ö†Ô∏è: This project is at initial stage and want contributors to help in development.
